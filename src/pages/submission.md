You can submit your abstract on this page once abstract submissions are open. When submitting, please keep in mind the following:

- Make sure your abstract does not exceed **2 pages** (including figures and references) and that it follows the [template](/Abstract_Template_AQL2025.docx) provided.
- Upload your abstract as a **PDF**.
- In the abstract submission form, please indicate whether you would prefer to present your work as an **oral presentation**, as a **poster presentation**, or **either**. (Please note that we might not be able to accommodate all preferences and, if your abstract is accepted, we might assign you to your non-preferred presentation mode if necessary.)
- Reviewing will be **single-blind** (i.e., reviewers will remain anonymous, but your name will be known to the reviewers and the programme committee). This means that you are free to reference your own previous work without anonymization.
- Submission deadline: **31 January 2025**.
- Notification of acceptance/rejection: **3 March 2025**.
